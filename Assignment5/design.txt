Features:
1. Multiple Sessions
    Modify the Client data structure on the server to know hold an array of session structures instead of just a single variable
    Error check with respect to which clients are in which session

    
2. Client Inactivity Timeout on the Server
    Add a start time value to the client data structure on the server
    Add a timeout to the select on the server so that the server doesn't block forever and can compute inactivity time for active clients
    Every time select returns compute time passed for all active clients
    If a client's time passed is longer than the expiration time, send a notification to the client, and logout the client
